# A File for storing what needs to be done

## Things we prolly need

- Object (maybe subclasses of diff shapes?)
- UI interface (pygame?)
- Collision handling
- Ability for user to set up scene
- Comprehensive tests for core logic
- Well documented code
- Fast code (just use libraries that will run it in C so no pyhton in this
  python project). Def use NumPy or CuPy.

## Decision we prolly need to make

- 2d or 3d? (idk how to do 3d put theres probably a way)
- How much to add? (like just dropping shapes and messing with bounciness and
  gravity or doing alot more idek). Also don't need to decide on this that soon.
